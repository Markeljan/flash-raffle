## Built for Encode Metaverse Hackathon!

#### Flash Raffle is an on-chain lottery with a twist!  10% of all mint fees go directly to Optimism Collective's retroPGF.eth address. Users mint TIX NFTs to be burned at a later date in exchange for envelopes with random prizes inside.

#### The minting is dynamic and the price to mint goes up as the jackpot increases!

#### This project is deployed on Optimism mainnet and is live!  Use at your own risk as funds are real and on mainnet OP.

#### Future update: envelopes can feature hidden items inside such as native tokens, ERC20 tokens, NFT's, discount codes, even IRL claimable swag!
Sponsors may inject prizes into Flash Raffles to onboard users and for brand awareness!

#### Token gating functionality achieved using [NiftyKit](https://app.niftykit.com)
